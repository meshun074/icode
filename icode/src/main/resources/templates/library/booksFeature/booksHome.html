		<h1 class="card-title">Book Object</h1>
		<br>
		<p>This Java class "Book" represents a book entity with properties like bookId, title, author,
			and description. It is annotated as a Spring component with a prototype scope.
			The class includes constructors for creating instances with unique IDs, getters and setters for the
			properties, and a method to generate unique IDs incrementally.
			The toString method is overridden to provide a string representation of the Book object.
			The static variable nextId is used to ensure each Book instance has a distinct ID.</p>

	<div class="instruction-card">
		<h1 class="card-title">BookRepository</h1>
		<br>
		<p>The Java class "BookRepository" serves as a repository for managing books in a library catalog.
			It is annotated as a Spring repository and contains methods for various book operations.
			The constructor initializes the repository with a list of books. Methods like `findAll`, `save`,
			`findByTitle`, `findByAuthor`, `deleteBookById`, `updateDescription`, `findById`, and `searchByBookId`
			handle functionalities such as retrieving all books, saving a new book with a generated ID, searching books
			by title or author,
			deleting a book by ID, updating a book's description, and finding a book by its ID. These methods utilize
			iteration or streams
			to perform the respective operations and return the desired book objects or null if not found.</p>

		<h1 class="card-title">BookService</h1>
		<br>
		<p>The Java class "BookService" serves as a service for managing books in a library catalog.
			It is annotated as a Spring service and contains methods for various book operations.
			The constructor initializes the service with a repository of books. Methods like `findAllBooks`, `saveBook`,
			`findBookByTitle`, `findBookByAuthor`, `deleteBookById`, `updateBookDescription`, `findBookById`, and
			`searchByBookId`
			handle functionalities such as retrieving all books, saving a new book with a generated ID, searching books
			by title or author,
			deleting a book by ID, updating a book's description, and finding a book by its ID. These methods utilize
			the repository
			to perform the respective operations and return the desired book objects or null if not found.</p>

		<h1 class="card-title">BookController</h1>
		<br>
		<p>The Java class "BookController" serves as a controller for managing books in a library catalog.
			It is annotated as a Spring controller and contains methods for various book operations.
			The constructor initializes the controller with a service for books. Methods like `getAllBooks`,
			`createBook`,
			`searchByTitle`, `searchByAuthor`, `deleteBookById`, `updateBookDescription`, `searchByBookId`, and
			`searchBookDetailsById`
			handle functionalities such as retrieving all books, saving a new book with a generated ID, searching books
			by title or author,
			deleting a book by ID, updating a book's description, and finding a book by its ID. These methods utilize
