			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p> Welcome to the Library Music Feature! This feature allows you to manage the music in our library.
				Usually, you can view all music, add a new album, add a new record, search for music by ID, title,
				artist, or genre, edit an album's description,
				edit a record's description, delete a record, and delete an album.
				But fortunately you are here now to help us fix some bugs and add some new features.
			</p>
		</section>

			<h3>Task 1</h3>
			<p> The first task is to fix the bug in the "All Music" page. The bug is that the "All Music" page is not
				displaying the music.
				You need to fix the bug so that the "All Music" page displays the music.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				To fix the bug, you need to go to the "All Music" page and check the code to see what is causing the
				bug.
				Once you find the bug, you need to fix it and test the "All Music" page to make sure it is displaying
				the music. You may need to reference the following annotations or tags:
			</p>

				<li>Review the "allMusic.html" template </li>
				<li>Review the "MusicController" class to make sure the correct logic is implemented to render the
					content.</li>
				<li>Review the "MusicService" class to make sure the correct logic is implemented to retrieve the music.
				</li>
				<li>Review the "MusicRepository" class to make sure the correct logic is implemented to retrieve the
					music.</li>
