			<h3>Library Location</h3> 
			<br>
			<p>Welcome to the Library Location Feature! Discover the diverse neighborhoods surrounding our library through this feature, 
				showcasing our central hub for community connection and engagement. 
			</p> 
			<p> 
				Time is of the essence! A bug in the Location Feature could hinder community involvement. Thank-you! For assisting us promptly in resolving this issue. 
			</p> 
		</section>


		<section class="instruction-card"> 
			<h3>Task 1</h3> 
			<br/> 
			<p> 
				Community outreach is impossible without community building. Our Library Locations bring together our diverse neighbors. So, it is vital that you fix the bug in the "AllLocations" page. 
				Make sure that the "AllLocations" page displays the locations. For now, don't worry about sorting them just make sure they display. 
			</p> 
			<br>
			<div class="img-container">
				<h3>Sample Table: </h3>
				<img th:src="@{/library/locationImages/AllLocations.png}" alt="All Locations UI" class="img-thumbnail">
			</div> 
			<br>
			<p>
				<ul> To Do:
					<li>First, you need to check the controller method that handles the request to display all locations.</li>
					<li>Then, you need to check the HTML code that displays the locations.</li>
					<li>Finally, you need to check the service method that retrieves all locations from the database.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Once you have fixed the bug, you can move on to the next task....Good Luck!
			</p>

			</div>
			<p>Once in a blue moon the stars align and we can open the doors to a new location. It is important that the add new location feature works correctly to keep our community inform of where they can 
				find us.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				To implement the "Add New Location" feature, you will need to perform the following steps:
				<ol>
					<li>Create a new controller method in your Spring application to handle the add request.</li>
					<li>Add a new button or link in the HTML code to trigger the add request.</li>
					<li>Pass the location information as parameters in the add request.</li>
					<li>In the controller method, retrieve the location information and use it to add the new location to the database.</li>
					<li>Handle any error scenarios, such as when the location information is incomplete or invalid.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<h3>Task 3</h3>
			<br>
			<p>
				Sometimes even when we do our best, we have to say good-bye to one of our locations. Please make sure that the "Delete Location By Id" featue works correctly.
			</p>
			<p>
				To implement the "Delete Location By Id" feature, you will need to perform the following steps:
				<ol>
					<li>Create a new controller method in your Spring application to handle the delete request.</li>
					<li>Add a new button or link in the HTML code to trigger the delete request.</li>
					<li>Pass the location ID as a parameter in the delete request.</li>
					<li>In the controller method, retrieve the location ID and use it to delete the corresponding location from the database.</li>
					<li>Handle any error scenarios, such as when the location ID does not exist.</li>
				</ol>

			<h3>Task 4</h3>
			<br>
			<p>
				Change is part of life. Our library sometimes has to change location based on the community's needs. 
				For this reason, we need to make sure that the "Update Location Address" feature works correctly.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				To implement the "Update Location Address" feature, you will need to perform the following steps:
				<ol>
					<li>Create a new controller method in your Spring application to handle the update request.</li>
					<li>Add a new button or link in the HTML code to trigger the update request.</li>
					<li>Pass the location ID and new address as parameters in the update request.</li>
					<li>In the controller method, retrieve the location ID and new address and use it to update the corresponding location in the database.</li>
					<li>Handle any error scenarios, such as when the location ID does not exist or the new address is invalid.</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Sample UI: </h3>

		</section>

		<section class="instruction-card">
			<h3>Task 5</h3>
			<br>
			<p>
				Our fifth task is to add a new feature by allowing users to search for locations by the location name. 
				You need to add a new page that allows users to search for locations by name. 
				Once the user enters the name, the page should display the location details.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				To implement the "Search Locations by Name" feature, you will need to perform the following steps:
				<ol>
					<li>Create a new controller method in your Spring application to handle the search request.</li>
					<li>Add a new input field and button in the HTML code to allow users to enter the location name and trigger the search request.</li>
					<li>Pass the location name as a parameter in the search request.</li>
					<li>In the controller method, retrieve the location name and use it to search for locations in the database.</li>
					<li>Display the location details on the page based on the search results.</li>
					<li>Handle any error scenarios, such as when no locations are found for the given name.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<br>
			<div class="img-container">
				<h3>Sample UI: </h3>
				<img th:src="@{/library/locationImages/searchLocationName.png}" alt="Search Location UI" class="img-thumbnail">
			</div>
		</section>

		<section class="instruction-card">
			<h3>Task 6</h3>
			<br>
			<p>
				You can continue refactoring the current functionality of locations to make it more efficient. You can also continue to practice
				by add search feature for each of the location attributes.
