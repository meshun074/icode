		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>Welcome to the Library Events Feature! This feature allows users to explore and participate in various
			community events organized by our library.
			These events bring together our diverse neighbors and help in community building.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Every minute our site has a bug may result in missed opportunities for community engagement.
			So, please hurry and help us fix the bug in the Events Features.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="instruction-card">
		<h3>Task 1</h3>
		<br />
		<p>
			Community outreach is impossible without community building. Our Library Events bring together our diverse
			neighbors. So, it is vital that you fix the bug in the "AllEvents" page.
			Make sure that the "AllEvents" page displays the events. For now, don't worry about sorting them just make
			sure they display
		</p>
		<br>
		<div class="img-container">
			<h3>Sample Table: </h3>
			<img th:src="@{/library/eventImages/AllEvents.png}" alt="All Library Events" lass="img-thumbnail">
		</div>
		<br>
		<p>
		<ol>To Do:
			<li>Review the "allEvents.html" template </li>
			<li>Review the "EventController" class to make sure the correct logic is implemented to render the content.
			</li>
			<li>Review the "EventService" class to make sure the correct logic is implemented to retrieve the events.
			</li>
			<li>Review the "EventRepository" class to make sure the correct logic is implemented to retrieve the events.
			</li>
		</ol>
		</p>

		<p>
			Once you have fixed the bug, you can move on to the next task....Good Luck!

		<h3>Task 2 </h3>
		<br>

		<div style="text-align: center;">
			<blockquote>
				<p>"By Failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail."</p>
				<footer>--Benjamin Franklin</footer>
			</blockquote>
		</div>

		<p>
			We cannot let our community down. So, our second Task is to debug the add new event feature to the Library
			event list.
			To fix the bug, go to the EventController to check that the appropriate code is there to render the AddEvent
			page. Once the correct
			code is in place, you will need to edit the AddEvent.html page to making sure the form adds a new event to
			the Library event list and redirects
			users to the allEvents page. Don't worry about sorting them just make sure the new event is displayed and
			added to the event list.

			<li>Review the "EventService" class to make sure the correct logic is implemented to create a new event.

			<li>Review the "EventRepository" class to make sure the correct logic is implemented to save the new event.

		<h3>Task 3</h3>
		<br />
		<p>Unfortunate situations occur, but that is no reason to spread misinformation. While we hate to cancel events,
			it is worst to have our patrons attend events that have been canceled.
			Please fix the bug in the "CancelEvent" page. Make sure the event can be found by the eventId. Once the
			event is found, confirm with the user that they want to cancel the event by Deleting it permanently.
			Once the event is deleted, the user should be redirected to the allEvents page and see the updated event
			list

		<h3>Task 4</h3>
		<br />
		<p>We are very thankful to our patrons donations. However, we must do our part. Selling tickets for events is a
			great way to foundraise. Please make sure the "PurchaseEventTickets" page
			displays all the upcoming events. It must have a form for our patrons to purchase tickets. To successfully
			submit the form, the user must include their Name, Email, Library Card Number, the Event Name,
			and the number of tickets they want to purchase. At this moment, we will just reserve the tickets and they
			can pay at the door.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			When the user submits the form, they should be prompted to confirm their purchase. Once the user confirms
			the purchase, they should be redirected to the confirmation page.

		<h3>Task 5</h3>
		<br />
		<p>Our fifth task is to add a new feature by allowing users to update the event Location.
			You need to make sure the Event controller has the correct path that allows users to navigate to the Update
			Event Location page.
			First, the user will be prompted to select the event they want to update the location for.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			A form should be displayed that allows the user to update the location for the selected event by the event
			Id.
			Once the user submits the form, they should be redirected to a page where they can update the location for
			the selected event.

		<h3>Task 6</h3>
		<br />
		<p>The final task in the Event feature is "Update Description By Id". Make sure the user can search for a
			library event using the eventId. If the event exists, the details associated with this event should be
			displayed for
			the user.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			If the event exists, a separate form should offer the user an opportunity to update the event description
			and save the changes.
			Once the user saves the changes, they should be redirected to the allEvents page and see the updated event
			description.
