			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>Welcome to the Library Donate Feature! This feature allows users to make donations to support our
				library.
				The donations help us acquire new books, improve our facilities, and provide better services to our
				patrons.
				We appreciate all the generosity and support in helping us fulfill our mission of promoting literacy and
				knowledge.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				As we well know, time is money. And, every minute our site is down may result in irreparable damage to
				our annual budget.
				So, please hurry and help us fix the bugs.
			</p>

			<h3>Task 1</h3>
			<br />
			<p>
				Transperancy is the life blood of non-profits. Having our budgetary allocations questioned won't go over
				well. So, your first
				task is to fix the bugs in the "AllDonations" page. The bug is that the "AllDonations" page is not
				displaying the donations we have received.
				You need to fix the bug so that the "AllDonations" page displays the donations. For now, don't worry
				about sorting them just make sure they display.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Once you have fixed the bug, you can move on to the next task....Good Luck!

			<ol>To Do:
				<li>Review the "allDonations.html" template </li>
				<li>Review the "DonationController" class to make sure the correct logic is implemented to render the
					content.</li>
				<li>Review the "DonationService" class to make sure the correct logic is implemented to retrieve the
					donations.</li>
				<li>Review the "DonationRepository" class to make sure the correct logic is implemented to retrieve the
					donations.</li>
			</ol>

		<section class="instruction-card">
			<h3>Task 2</h3>
			<br />
			<p>
				Keeping our donation form alive and active is essential to all our outreach programs. Your next task is
				to fix the bugs in the "AddDonation" page.
				Make sure patrons can add their donations to the library. You will need to edit the AddDonation.html
				page to make sure the form adds a new donation to the library catalog and redirects
				users to the allDonations page. They should be able to see their names and the amount they donated being
				recognized for all the good they do for the community.

			<h3>Task 3 </h3>
			<br />
			<p>
				Mistakes have been known to happen...sometimes we add a little zero that doesn't belong there. Ooops!
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>Your task is to make sure the Edit Donation Amount page works correctly. The user should be able to
				search for their donation by the donation id. If the donation record exists the details of the record
				should be displayed on a card. A separate form should offer the user an opportunity to update the
				donation amount and save the changes. The user should be redirected to the allDonations page and see
				the updated donation amount.

			<h3>Task 4</h3>
			<br />
			<p>All of our community outreach programs are deserving of support...but sometimes programs receive more
				than they need. In this event, users should have the opportunity to edit the target programs
				they would like their donations to support. Your task is to make sure the Edit Donation Program page
				works correctly. The user should be able to search for their donation by the donation id.
				If the donation record exists the details of the record should be displayed for the user. A separate
				form should offer the user an opportunity to update the donation program and save the changes.
				Once the user saves the changes, they should be redirected to the allDonations page and see the updated
				donation program.

			<h3>Task 5</h3>
			<br />
			<p> Our next task is to make sure the Delete Donation page works correctly. The user should be able to
				search for their donation by the donation id. If the donation record exists the user should be prompted
				to confirm that they want to delete the donation record. Once the user confirms the deletion, they
				should be redirected to the allDonations page and see the updated donation list.

			<h3>Task 6</h3>
			<br />
			<p>Tax season is upon us...while we don't recommend making donations for the tax benefits, we do want to
				make sure our patrons have the information they need to claim their donations. Your task is to make sure
				the
				"Donation Receipt By Name" page works correctly. The user should be able to search for their donation by
				their full name. If the donation record exists the details of the record should be displayed for the
				user.
				Don't worry about the pdf download.
