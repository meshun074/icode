			<h3>Task 7</h3>
			<br />
			<section>
				<p>
					It is unfortunate but sometimes a book needs to be retired from the catalog for an array of reasons.
				</p>
				<br />

				permanently.
				To do this, you need to add a new page that allows users to search for books by ID and delete the book.
				Please note that once a book is deleted, it cannot be recovered. So, it is important to be sure that the
				book should be deleted by validating the user's action.
				Once the user enters the ID, the book should be deleted from the library catalog and the user redirected
				to the "All Books" page.
