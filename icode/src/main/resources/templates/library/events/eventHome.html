		<h1 class="card-title">Event Object</h1>
		<br>
		<p>This Java class "Event" represents an event entity with properties like eventId, title, description,
			and location. It is annotated as a Spring component with a prototype scope.
			The class includes constructors for creating instances with unique IDs, getters and setters for the
			properties, and a method to generate unique IDs incrementally.
			The toString method is overridden to provide a string representation of the Event object.
			The static variable nextId is used to ensure each Event instance has a distinct ID.</p>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="instruction-card">
		<h1 class="card-title">EventRepository</h1>
		<br>
		<p>The Java class "EventRepository" serves as a repository for managing events in a library catalog.
			It is annotated as a Spring repository and contains methods for various event operations.
			The constructor initializes the repository with a list of events. Methods like `findAll`, `save`,
			`findByTitle`, `findByLocation`, `deleteEventById`, `updateDescription`, `findById`, and `searchByEventId`
			handle functionalities such as retrieving all events, saving a new event with a generated ID, searching
			events by title or location,
			deleting an event by ID, updating an event's description, and finding an event by its ID. These methods
			utilize iteration or streams
			to perform the respective operations and return the desired event objects or null if not found.</p>

	<div class="instruction-card">
		<h1 class="card-title">EventService</h1>
		<br>
		<p>The Java class "EventService" serves as a service for managing events in a library catalog.
			It is annotated as a Spring service and contains methods for various event operations.
			The constructor initializes the service with a repository of events. Methods like `findAllEvents`,
			`saveEvent`,
			`findEventByTitle`, `findEventByLocation`, `deleteEventById`, `updateEventDescription`, `findEventById`, and
			`searchByEventId`
			handle functionalities such as retrieving all events, saving a new event with a generated ID, searching
			events by title or location,
			deleting an event by ID, updating an event's description, and finding an event by its ID. These methods
			utilize the repository
			to perform the respective operations and return the desired event objects or null if not found.</p>

		<h1 class="card-title">EventController</h1>
		<br>
		<p>The Java class "EventController" serves as a controller for managing events in a library catalog.
			It is annotated as a Spring controller and contains methods for various event operations.
			The constructor initializes the controller with a service for events. Methods like `getAllEvents`,
			`createEvent`,
			`searchByTitle`, `searchByLocation`, `deleteEventById`, `updateEventDescription`, `searchByEventId`, and
			`searchEventDetailsById`
			handle functionalities such as retrieving all events, saving a new event with a generated ID, searching
			events by title or location,
			deleting an event by ID, updating an event's description, and finding an event by its ID. These methods
			utilize the service
			to perform the respective operations and return the desired event objects or null if not found.</p>
