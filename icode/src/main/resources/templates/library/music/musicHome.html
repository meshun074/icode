		<h1 class="card-title">Music Abstract Class</h1>
		<br>
		<p>The Java abstract class "Music" represents a music entity with properties like musicId, title, artist,
			and genre. It serves as a base class for specific types of music such as albums and records.
			It includes constructors for creating instances with unique IDs, getters and setters for the properties,
			and a method to generate unique IDs incrementally. The toString method is overridden to provide a string
			representation of the Music object. The abstract method "play" is defined to be implemented by subclasses.
		</p>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="instruction-card">
		<h1 class="card-title">Album Class</h1>
		<br>
		<p>The Java class "Album" extends the Music abstract class and represents an album entity.
			It includes additional properties like releaseDate and description. The class includes constructors
			for creating instances with unique IDs, getters and setters for the properties, and a method to
			generate unique IDs incrementally. The toString method is overridden to provide a string representation
			of the Album object. The "play" method is implemented to play all the songs in the album.</p>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="instruction-card">
		<h1 class="card-title">Record Class</h1>
		<br>
		<p>The Java class "Record" extends the Music abstract class and represents a record entity.
			It includes additional properties like releaseYear and description. The class includes constructors
			for creating instances with unique IDs, getters and setters for the properties, and a method to
			generate unique IDs incrementally. The toString method is overridden to provide a string representation
			of the Record object. The "play" method is implemented to play the specific song on the record.</p>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="instruction-card">
		<h1 class="card-title">MusicService Class</h1>
		<br>
		<p>The Java class "MusicService" serves as a service for managing music in a library catalog.
			It contains methods for various music operations. The constructor initializes the service with a
			repository of music. Methods like `getAllMusic`, `saveMusic`, `findMusicByTitle`, `findMusicByArtist`,
			`deleteMusicById`, `updateMusicDescription`, `findMusicById`, and `searchMusicDetailsById` handle
			functionalities such as retrieving all music, saving new music with generated IDs, searching music by
			title or artist, deleting music by ID, updating music's description, and finding music by its ID.
			These methods utilize the repository to perform the respective operations and return the desired
			music objects or null if not found.</p>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="instruction-card">
		<h1 class="card-title">MusicRepository Class</h1>
		<br>
		<p>The Java class "MusicRepository" serves as a repository for managing music in a library catalog.
			It contains methods for various music operations. The constructor initializes the repository with a
			list of music. Methods like `findAllMusic`, `saveMusic`, `findByTitle`, `findByArtist`, `deleteMusicById`,
			`updateDescription`, `findById`, and `searchByMusicId` handle functionalities such as retrieving all music,
			saving new music with generated IDs, searching music by title or artist, deleting music by ID, updating
			music's description, and finding music by its ID. These methods utilize iteration or streams to perform
			the respective operations and return the desired music objects or null if not found.</p>

	<div class="mb-5 instruction-card">
		<h1 class="card-title">MusicController Class</h1>
		<br>
		<p>The Java class "MusicController" serves as a controller for managing music in a library catalog.
			It contains methods for various music operations. The constructor initializes the controller with a
			service for music. Methods like `getAllMusic`, `createMusic`, `searchByTitle`, `searchByArtist`,
			`deleteMusicById`, `updateMusicDescription`, `searchByMusicId`, and `searchMusicDetailsById` handle
			functionalities such as retrieving all music, saving new music with generated IDs, searching music by
