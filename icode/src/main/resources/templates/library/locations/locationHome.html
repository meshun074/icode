		<h1 class="card-title">Location Object</h1>
		<br>
		<p>This Java class "Location" represents a location entity with properties like locationId, name, address,
			and capacity. It is annotated as a Spring component with a prototype scope.
			The class includes constructors for creating instances with unique IDs, getters and setters for the
			properties, and a method to generate unique IDs incrementally.
			The toString method is overridden to provide a string representation of the Location object.
			The static variable nextId is used to ensure each Location instance has a distinct ID.</p>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="instruction-card">
		<h1 class="card-title">LocationRepository</h1>
		<br>
		<p>The Java class "LocationRepository" serves as a repository for managing locations in a library system.
			It is annotated as a Spring repository and contains methods for various location operations.
			The constructor initializes the repository with a list of locations. Methods like `findAll`, `save`,
			`findByName`, `findByAddress`, `deleteLocationById`, `updateCapacity`, `findById`, and `searchByLocationId`
			handle functionalities such as retrieving all locations, saving a new location with a generated ID,
			searching locations by name or address,
			deleting a location by ID, updating a location's capacity, and finding a location by its ID. These methods
			utilize iteration or streams
			to perform the respective operations and return the desired location objects or null if not found.</p>

	<div class="instruction-card">
		<h1 class="card-title">LocationService</h1>
		<br>
		<p>The Java class "LocationService" serves as a service for managing locations in a library system.
			It is annotated as a Spring service and contains methods for various location operations.
			The constructor initializes the service with a repository of locations. Methods like `findAllLocations`,
			`saveLocation`,
			`findLocationByName`, `findLocationByAddress`, `deleteLocationById`, `updateLocationCapacity`,
			`findLocationById`, and `searchByLocationId`
			handle functionalities such as retrieving all locations, saving a new location with a generated ID,
			searching locations by name or address,
			deleting a location by ID, updating a location's capacity, and finding a location by its ID. These methods
			utilize the repository
			to perform the respective operations and return the desired location objects or null if not found.</p>

		<h1 class="card-title">LocationController</h1>
		<br>
		<p>The Java class "LocationController" serves as a controller for managing locations in a library system.
			It is annotated as a Spring controller and contains methods for various location operations.
			The constructor initializes the controller with a service for locations. Methods like `getAllLocations`,
			`createLocation`,
			`searchByName`, `searchByAddress`, `deleteLocationById`, `updateLocationCapacity`, `searchByLocationId`, and
			`searchLocationDetailsById`
			handle functionalities such as retrieving all locations, saving a new location with a generated ID,
			searching locations by name or address,
			deleting a location by ID, updating a location's capacity, and finding a location by its ID. These methods
			utilize the service
			to perform the respective operations and return the desired location objects or null if not found.</p>
